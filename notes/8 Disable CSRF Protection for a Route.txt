Normally when you submit a form through the Laravel application the form includes a CSRF token.

When using POSTMAN to work on simply a backend application we are not using forms hence not sending CSRF tokens with requests.

This results in an error.

To illiminate this error we must inform Laravel which routes do not need CSRF token protection.

To do this go to the directory location in the Laravel application :


app/middleware/VerifyCsrfToken.php


Within this file find the code :



class VerifyCsrfToken extends Middleware
{
    /**
     * The URIs that should be excluded from CSRF verification.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $except = [

    ];
}



Change it to :



class VerifyCsrfToken extends Middleware
{
    /**
     * The URIs that should be excluded from CSRF verification.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $except = [
        
        'api/*'
    ];
}



Now any route that starts with     api     will be allowed to be used without causing an error
