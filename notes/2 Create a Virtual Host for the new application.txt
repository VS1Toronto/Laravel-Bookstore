We need to create a virtual host that points to location :

http://localhost/sampleapp/public/index.php



STEP 1

To do this go to C:/xampp/apache/conf/extra


Open the file     httpd-vhosts.conf


Add these lines below the exising code, these are virtual host entries :


<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs"
    ServerName localhost
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/sampleapp/public"
    ServerName sampleapp.dev
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/basicwebsite/public"
    ServerName basicwebsite.dev
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/todolist/public"
    ServerName todolist.dev
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/larabiz/public"
    ServerName larabiz.dev
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/photoshow/public"
    ServerName photoshow.dev
</VirtualHost>



STEP 2

Next open file C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc


Ensure the vieing of     all files     in the lower right hand corner
is selected



Open file hosts in administrator with Notepad++


Add these lines below the existing code :


# This     127.0.0.1 localhost     is for XAMPP
#
# Another addition     127.0.0.1 lsapp.dev     is for  the     laravel_traversy     application
