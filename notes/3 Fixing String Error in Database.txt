Laravel 5.4: Specified key was too long error 

To see what this error is and find out anout it go to this url :

https://laravel-news.com/laravel-5-4-key-too-long-error



To fix the error you have to edit your     AppServiceProvider.php file :

its located at     app\Providers\AppServiceProvider.php


Within this file you will find this boot method which is empty :


<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function boot()
    {
        //
    }
	
	
	
change it to :



<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function boot()
    {
        Schema::defaultStringLength(191);
    }

	
	
	
	
	
This use statement is necessary to use the schema :

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;


This use statement is necessary to alter the schema :

Schema::defaultStringLength(191);



Once both lines are in and it looks like the code above save it
and everything should run fine
